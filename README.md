# 👋 Hi there, I'm Wesley Methorst!

🎓 I’m currently studying **ICT at Fontys University of Applied Sciences** in Eindhoven (Bachelor level), following the **Open Learning track**. This unique path allows me to shape my own learning outcomes and create a personalized learning route that aligns with my goals and passions.

🚀 My ambition is to build my own business in the tech field, combining creativity, technology, and entrepreneurship. I'm currently focusing on **JavaScript** as my main specialization, with the goal of mastering it deeply as I grow into a professional developer.

💻 I primarily work as a **Front-End Developer**, with a strong interest in expanding toward the back end in the future. My ultimate aim is to become a **Full-Stack Developer**, but for now, I’m honing my skills on the front-end side.
