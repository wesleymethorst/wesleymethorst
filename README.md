# 👋 Hi, I'm Wesley Methorst

🎓 I'm currently studying **ICT at Fontys University of Applied Sciences**, following the **Open Learning track**. This flexible path allows me to shape my own learning outcomes and build a personalized route that aligns with my goals.

🚀 My ambition is to create my **own tech business**, combining creativity, development, and entrepreneurship. I'm currently developing my skills across both **front-end and back-end** technologies, with a strong focus on JavaScript and modern web development.

💻 I work as a **Full-Stack Developer in progress**, building experience in both client-side and server-side development. I enjoy working with **Vue, Nuxt.js, TailwindCSS**, and expanding my backend skills using **databases and APIs**.
