# 👋 Hi, I'm Wesley Methorst

🎓 I'm currently studying **ICT at Fontys University of Applied Sciences**, following the **Open Learning track**. This flexible path allows me to shape my own learning outcomes and build a personalized route that aligns with my goals.

🚀 My ambition is to create my **own tech business**, combining creativity, development, and entrepreneurship. Right now, I'm sharpening my expertise in **JavaScript** and modern front-end frameworks as I grow into a professional developer.

💻 I primarily work as a **Front-End Developer** with a strong focus on **Vue** and **Nuxt.js**. In the future, I aim to expand further into backend development to eventually become a **Full-Stack Developer**.
